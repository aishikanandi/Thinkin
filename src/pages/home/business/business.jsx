          Holistic: Binding whole as one but not just a part.
          Holistic marketing, by name implies that a business considering all the departments working together for the relevant marketing activities with a shared goal.
          Components of holistic marketing:
          Internal Marketing
          Majorly focuses on the in-house employees, ensures their all-round satisfaction in order to allow the employees to work in accordance with the goals of the organization. It is hence observed, greater the satisfaction, deeper is the coordination. In a way internal marketing serves more towards the needs of the internal employees for their well being and to ensure that there exists no strife* amongst each other.
          Integrated marketing
          All the internal departments working towards the success of logical and transparent message of the organization is integrated marketing. The departments clearly encompass all kinds of media owned media (social media page), paid media (TV commercials) and earned media (feedbacks from customers).
          Performance Marketing
          Business organizations working towards cost reduction goals.  Organizations are highly focused on the return on investments on the activities on which amounts are budgeted and invested. Therefore, on a long run increase in sale and decrease in cost is continuously endeavored* upon. 
          Relationship Marketing
          Holistic view in marketing always looks not only for short-run but also for a long-run relationship. A short-run relation with end consumers is the token to establishing a strong relationship on the long-run. Advantage of having both short and long sight of customer relationship is that, it elevates* the motivation for internal employees which in turn elevates the end customer satisfaction. Therefore, this is one such view which takes care of many kinds of stakeholder’s dependent on the organization directly or indirectly.

          <Link to="/mark3" className='postLink'><Post imageUrl="https://pwpblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/D2C-Ecommerce.png" category="marketing" title="D2C: Direct-To-Consumers" 
          content="This morning I stumbled upon couple of interesting plots. One thought that fascinated me to write on was, how Direct-To-Consumers (D2C) business model has been hitting the trends post-pandemic.
 
          D2C has grown by the prophesied growth rate i.e., by 20% in 2021. It is also speculated that India’s D2C market is likely to reach an expansion of approximately $100 billion by 2025 observing its exponential growth in the past few years.
           
          What's in it for the market to pay keen attention to is that this business model is likely to strengthen the growth of the fashion industry the most. High time for the fashion industry to gear up! Fashion establishments hold the largest share in the D2C segment capturing a chunk of 45% of the market share.
           
          This is the internet era after all. All of us are connected through some online spaces. The top-notch brands are just hitting these spaces to reach us and leveraging the opportunities of D2C. Some interesting business cases I would like to share, which fascinated me to know more about such a trend in the market.
           
          Adidas makes its presence felt through this promotional effort, including its fans in the sales funnel. Boat is yet another famous brand that made its D2C model very successful post-pandemic by just hitting the target audience over YouTube by engaging them in a crisp 15-second video ad. They have moved from the conventional advertising model to a crisp content ad model to ensure Call-To-Action (CTA) for every viewership they receive.
           
          The success of a D2C business model can be observed when your stats speak that 50-60% of consumers would be willing to share more information with your brands to allow them to have a better shopping experience. Total control over the data that brands gather is another important facet.
           
          I was glad to share my opinion with the readers. Would like this forum to be open for some discussions on, that can we safely assume, since D2C is trending, hence bigger brands be looking to position more on D2C models. Or else it was just the pandemic that brought people more to the online platform, and with time D2C will be an apart of the same usual crowd of business models?
