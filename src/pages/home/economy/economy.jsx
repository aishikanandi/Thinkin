Readers! You must have come across this scenario very well during your childhood. Feeling nostalgic about your childhood, right? :D
 
Today’s discussion is based on similar lines. UPI demolishes the toffee business in India. Very often we are billed an amount of Rs 48 or Rs 97 or Rs 497 and we always get two to three toffees in return. Have you ever wondered what profit margins the store owners earned by returning toffees as change equivalents of 2-3 Rs? Under normal circumstances, a Kirana store used to earn approximately 67% profit over a month or two.  Now with the availability of UPI transactions we as consumers have the edge to pay exactly Rs 48 or Rs 97 or Rs 147 and so on. The toffees lying inside those huge glass jars find themselves no customers now. The toffees over the shelf are liabilities for the store owners now.
 
Research says that there have been approximately 680 crore UPI transactions worth 12 lakh crore. There has been a steep decline in toffees reported by Nestle, ITC, Parle, and Mars. Hershey's which has been a prominent player in toffees and chocolate production has found itself to be affected the worst in the Indian market post the COVID pandemic. Two main reasons have been; the contactless payment, the other being the hassle-free payment mode without worrying about the coins in exchange.
 
Therefore, the takeaway for readers from this post is that we could see how a financial instrument has replaced a tangible commodity. As a result, consumer behaviour of purchasing has been affected to a greater extent by UPI. This seems to put the best product lines of some giant players in markets at greater risk. I believe that good branding and strategic positioning of the product over the counter is the need of the hour by the market giants. I hence would keep this forum open for some healthy discussion. What I would like to hear from the readers is that would it be right to assume that the growth of UPI in the Indian market at this rate can move the profit-making commodity like toffees towards extinction. Has UPI completely demolished the candy market? How do you think the market should react to this hereafter? Would be glad to see you opine on this. Jovial reading!"></Post></Link>

        Relax! If you couldn't comprehend, let me spill the beans, it is lately seen that the Indian stock market is heading in an entirely different direction when compared to the other stock market. India is the only large market that has crossed previous record highs despite rising inflation.
        
        A very notable reason that is seen from the latest updates on inflation is that the US has started offering a little bit of relief and the Federal Reserve has given some breathing space to reduce inflation due to which investors are now able to invest more amount in our country. This is because the investors do appreciate the fact that the most returns can be obtained from the Indian market only.
        It was also seen that when the inflation rates were very high in the year 2021 the Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPI) had pulled out approximately 3 lakhs crore from the Indian market but with relief, on the inflation rate from the Federal Reserves, the foreign portfolio investors as per the current survey tell that there has been a hefty injection of around 3000 crores into Indian stock market and if inflation rates continue to remain steady then FPI is expected to invest more in Indian equities. India is now being seen as a new investment terminus.
        
        Such heavy investment brings more confidence to the market players in the market. What's in there for the investors is that people who earlier invested just in savings and fixed deposits would tend to get less return but in situations like this where inflation rates tend to shoot high, a decision to invest in equities is the wisest way to be ensured with higher returns. It is very important for readers to understand why there was this sudden jump in the Indian stock market due to the nature of returns investors would now be able to draw from equity investments because Foreign Portfolio Investors invest only in equities of the country which has a very robust and effective government, which punctuates to the fact that our country India undoubtedly has effective governance in place, which could instill the sense of confidence amongst the FPI's.
        
        What I would like to know from the readers is that can we agree on the fact that Foreign Portfolio Investment would remain only a power play hitter (obtaining short-run profits) or if can we eye towards long-run profitable investments. Also, would like to hear your opinion on what are the micro managerial implications of such investments in time of shooting inflation. Jovial reading!"></Post></Link>

        content="Nayiiiii socchh...... Nayaaa Protsaahan (New ideas, new encouragements)
 
 I was yet again amazed to read an interesting article, that India's Foreign Trade Policy aims to boost India's exports to $2 trillion by 2030 that too without any sunset clause, so I felt to share it with readers and get what your intellectual opinion would be.
  
 But what is so specific about it?
  
 I give you food for thought. During any kind of inter-nation tensions, exports from our country are heavily impacted. Therefore, how could a nation probably recover from the loss?
  
 Most important aspects such as 'Make In India' efforts are focused post this agenda, where increased participation from states is ensured to boost the culture of exporting from the very grassroots level.
  
 Another important aspect, this new agenda has asked to bolster merchandise exports as well which can equally keep up with the service exports.
  
 One very important move by the commerce ministry is that our nation will not rely more on subsidies to boost exports but rather culturally utilize the workforce to export invaluable products.
  
 For the managerial implications I believe, the new foreign trade policy can potentially create new opportunities for businesses by opening new markets, reducing trade barriers, and providing incentives for exports. On the contrary, I also believe it can also pose challenges for industries that rely heavily on imports or face increased competition from foreign firms.
  
 Let us find out what you guys think, and what can be good about our new agenda. Would like to know from the readers. Jovial reading!!"></Post></Link>

    content="'RBI launches India's first Digital rupee' hitting the trending news section. Yet another FinTech advancement we must be proud of our country India, has advanced towards.

    What is a digital rupee now? Heard about E-money, Digital money, and cryptocurrency, what is a digital rupee? Let me spill this straight and easy. As we know e-money that has become an integral part of our life, involved in day-to-day transactions, they have a legal tender, which means they have a form or structure, whereas a digital rupee does not have one. 'A form of existence without existing.' Yet there would be a commercial existence of the same. So far RBI had decided to proceed with the pilot project from November 1, 2022. The pilot project for retail digital rupee would take a month or so.
    
    Do you know, the digital rupee would make payment cheaper? Yes, you read it right. Now let us see how. The digital rupee is programmable money. Lending may be its primary application. A desire to buy an automobile, the exact equivalent of digital rupees could be used for that only without having to worry about interests and charges to pay on holding the cash equivalents. This will make it easier to trace the money and help banks have fewer non-performing assets. According to the RBI, digital rupee is required to safeguard consumers from the horrifying degree of volatility exhibited in some virtual currencies that lack sovereign backing. Another very interesting fact to know from an economist perspective is that, when the economy would require cash to be injected into the market due to which people would have cash withdrawn and have had held with them, this could be prevented with the usage of the digital rupee, hence during the crisis the economy always has ensured people cannot hold cash. All of these would impact consumer buying behaviors.
    
    What marketers need to realize is that digital money can increase global trade, enhance financial inclusion, and transform how we spend, save, and do business in ways we most likely do not even completely comprehend now. Therefore, there is an opportunity for improvised global branding. The introduction of the digital rupee has the potential to reduce the cost of payments, therefore positioning products will become more crucial than just branding.
    
    What human resources should consider now, though the digital rupee is not under blockchain technology yet the technologies used to keep the system running would require an extended technical knowledge base. It would also demand the extension of talent centers to find, select and recruit, train, and expand the technical talent base. It would also require major OD interventions with respect to doing business-to-consumer or business-to-business commerce in the market.
    
    Now the forum would remain open for discussions on the topic. Opinions on how digital rupees and its impact on market & marketing strategies, human resources highly appreciated. Jovial reading!"></Post></Link>
