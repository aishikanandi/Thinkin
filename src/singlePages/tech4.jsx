      content="Suno! Ye kya ab bhi purane OS par ho, naya OS dalwalo abb! Yet another outstanding Aatmanirbhar Abhiyaan feat unlocked. The BharOS. A new Operating system that soon our smartphones will be able to run. Finally, we have a new player in the market!
 
      The BharOS was developed by J & K operations Private limited under the incubation of IIT Madras and Pravartak technology foundation. This new operating system puts all users at ease while considering security. It is claimed to be the best secure box where the user gets all the control. That is the USP! Once the user is assured full control, I guess you would not doubt its security again. It gives the flexibility to the user to choose the app that suits their needs. Data belongs to the consumers, and with this novel idea, this OS was created. This OS can empower you whether to collect data or not. Now isn't this interesting.
       
      We have often had issues with pre-installed applications that took up memory on our gadgets, but with the emergence of BharOS, users will be able to get the most out of their storage space. The days of manually updating applications will be over. Apps would now be automatically updated. Next, one might like to know what kinds of apps he/she can install on his/her phone. Then PASS, a private app store service that provides a handpicked list of applications that have been properly examined and have met all security and privacy standards, would come into action.
       
      In conclusion, we can understand one thing it is an honour to have a separate operating system guided by India, running alongside big giants. Though studies so far cannot evidently state the efficacy of this initiative because it has not been launched completely rather only specific segments have been given access to it.
       
      Forum is now open! This time I would like the readers to pinpoint the challenges BharOS might face in the tough tech ecosystem. I know a few!! Letâ€™s see whether you can pinpoint it or not. Would like to hear and discuss this. Jovial Reading!!" />
