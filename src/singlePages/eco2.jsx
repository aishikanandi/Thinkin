        Relax! If you couldn't comprehend, let me spill the beans, it is lately seen that the Indian stock market is heading in an entirely different direction when compared to the other stock market. India is the only large market that has crossed previous record highs despite rising inflation.
        
        A very notable reason that is seen from the latest updates on inflation is that the US has started offering a little bit of relief and the Federal Reserve has given some breathing space to reduce inflation due to which investors are now able to invest more amount in our country. This is because the investors do appreciate the fact that the most returns can be obtained from the Indian market only.
        It was also seen that when the inflation rates were very high in the year 2021 the Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPI) had pulled out approximately 3 lakhs crore from the Indian market but with relief, on the inflation rate from the Federal Reserves, the foreign portfolio investors as per the current survey tell that there has been a hefty injection of around 3000 crores into Indian stock market and if inflation rates continue to remain steady then FPI is expected to invest more in Indian equities. India is now being seen as a new investment terminus.
        
        Such heavy investment brings more confidence to the market players in the market. What's in there for the investors is that people who earlier invested just in savings and fixed deposits would tend to get less return but in situations like this where inflation rates tend to shoot high, a decision to invest in equities is the wisest way to be ensured with higher returns. It is very important for readers to understand why there was this sudden jump in the Indian stock market due to the nature of returns investors would now be able to draw from equity investments because Foreign Portfolio Investors invest only in equities of the country which has a very robust and effective government, which punctuates to the fact that our country India undoubtedly has effective governance in place, which could instill the sense of confidence amongst the FPI's.
        
        What I would like to know from the readers is that can we agree on the fact that Foreign Portfolio Investment would remain only a power play hitter (obtaining short-run profits) or if can we eye towards long-run profitable investments. Also, would like to hear your opinion on what are the micro managerial implications of such investments in time of shooting inflation. Jovial reading!"></Single>
