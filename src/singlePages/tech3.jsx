      content="Once upon a time, there was a budding thought, that how are humongous projects developed to ensure the deliverables are met precisely. Projects which have heavy investments ranging from lakhs to crores of rupees. Who or what assures the working of these projects or products in the market? This was a random thought. But then the other day I come across a terminology Digital twin technology which answered my question.
      To introduce Digital twin, it is a technology that creates a virtual replica of the actual product and real-time simulations on the virtual clone that helps to take decisions better. What benefits you as a product owner here is that, the clone has been trained well with the real-time data that has interacted with the environment, and hence you as a product marketer can easily eliminate the redundancies that the market wouldn't be looking for. Thanks to IoT blending with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) has disrupted technology which has led many organizations to consider Digital twin technology. 
      What the market and the marketers should consider is the market attractiveness of Digital Twin technology. IoT stays and is emerging victorious in every front of the market. A USD 49 billion market of digital twining technology is expected by 2026, based on estimates from industry specialists. Businesses now have an unmatched understanding of how their products function because to digital twins. A digital twin can be used to locate possible issues, conduct remote troubleshooting, and ultimately raise client satisfaction. Additionally, it aids in product differentiation.
      What's in it for Human Resource management to ponder is that digital twin technology holds the potential to create a whole new universe of possibilities for utilizing data to streamline operations by scrutinizing many crucial factors. The key areas can be aided by setting up a digital twin framework around job role design, training programs, and future skills and competencies. Organizations could proactively monitor workloads using digital twin technologies. Digital twin tech can provide an immersive environment where anything can be transformed into a digital experience by leveraging other technologies, such as Augmented Reality (AR), ML, and Deep Learning when considering human resource facet.
      I would hence keep this forum open for an engaging discussion to know the reader's opinion that how prevalent product owners or developers in the market would find Digital Twin technology. Secondly, would also like to know whether human resource management believes that such an intervention of Digital Twin, could impact the human resources of an organization or if is it a far-fetched term seeming to be quite fascinating in this process of technological transformation.
