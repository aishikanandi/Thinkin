        content="Nayiiiii socchh...... Nayaaa Protsaahan (New ideas, new encouragements)
 
 I was yet again amazed to read an interesting article, that India's Foreign Trade Policy aims to boost India's exports to $2 trillion by 2030 that too without any sunset clause, so I felt to share it with readers and get what your intellectual opinion would be.
  
 But what is so specific about it?
  
 I give you food for thought. During any kind of inter-nation tensions, exports from our country are heavily impacted. Therefore, how could a nation probably recover from the loss?
  
 Most important aspects such as 'Make In India' efforts are focused post this agenda, where increased participation from states is ensured to boost the culture of exporting from the very grassroots level.
  
 Another important aspect, this new agenda has asked to bolster merchandise exports as well which can equally keep up with the service exports.
  
 One very important move by the commerce ministry is that our nation will not rely more on subsidies to boost exports but rather culturally utilize the workforce to export invaluable products.
  
 For the managerial implications I believe, the new foreign trade policy can potentially create new opportunities for businesses by opening new markets, reducing trade barriers, and providing incentives for exports. On the contrary, I also believe it can also pose challenges for industries that rely heavily on imports or face increased competition from foreign firms.
  
 Let us find out what you guys think, and what can be good about our new agenda. Would like to know from the readers. Jovial reading!!"></Single>
