Readers! You must have come across this scenario very well during your childhood. Feeling nostalgic about your childhood, right? :D
 
Today’s discussion is based on similar lines. UPI demolishes the toffee business in India. Very often we are billed an amount of Rs 48 or Rs 97 or Rs 497 and we always get two to three toffees in return. Have you ever wondered what profit margins the store owners earned by returning toffees as change equivalents of 2-3 Rs? Under normal circumstances, a Kirana store used to earn approximately 67% profit over a month or two.  Now with the availability of UPI transactions we as consumers have the edge to pay exactly Rs 48 or Rs 97 or Rs 147 and so on. The toffees lying inside those huge glass jars find themselves no customers now. The toffees over the shelf are liabilities for the store owners now.
 
Research says that there have been approximately 680 crore UPI transactions worth 12 lakh crore. There has been a steep decline in toffees reported by Nestle, ITC, Parle, and Mars. Hershey's which has been a prominent player in toffees and chocolate production has found itself to be affected the worst in the Indian market post the COVID pandemic. Two main reasons have been; the contactless payment, the other being the hassle-free payment mode without worrying about the coins in exchange.
 
Therefore, the takeaway for readers from this post is that we could see how a financial instrument has replaced a tangible commodity. As a result, consumer behaviour of purchasing has been affected to a greater extent by UPI. This seems to put the best product lines of some giant players in markets at greater risk. I believe that good branding and strategic positioning of the product over the counter is the need of the hour by the market giants. I hence would keep this forum open for some healthy discussion. What I would like to hear from the readers is that would it be right to assume that the growth of UPI in the Indian market at this rate can move the profit-making commodity like toffees towards extinction. Has UPI completely demolished the candy market? How do you think the market should react to this hereafter? Would be glad to see you opine on this. Jovial reading!"></Single>
