    content="'RBI launches India's first Digital rupee' hitting the trending news section. Yet another FinTech advancement we must be proud of our country India, has advanced towards.

    What is a digital rupee now? Heard about E-money, Digital money, and cryptocurrency, what is a digital rupee? Let me spill this straight and easy. As we know e-money that has become an integral part of our life, involved in day-to-day transactions, they have a legal tender, which means they have a form or structure, whereas a digital rupee does not have one. 'A form of existence without existing.' Yet there would be a commercial existence of the same. So far RBI had decided to proceed with the pilot project from November 1, 2022. The pilot project for retail digital rupee would take a month or so.
    
    Do you know, the digital rupee would make payment cheaper? Yes, you read it right. Now let us see how. The digital rupee is programmable money. Lending may be its primary application. A desire to buy an automobile, the exact equivalent of digital rupees could be used for that only without having to worry about interests and charges to pay on holding the cash equivalents. This will make it easier to trace the money and help banks have fewer non-performing assets. According to the RBI, digital rupee is required to safeguard consumers from the horrifying degree of volatility exhibited in some virtual currencies that lack sovereign backing. Another very interesting fact to know from an economist perspective is that, when the economy would require cash to be injected into the market due to which people would have cash withdrawn and have had held with them, this could be prevented with the usage of the digital rupee, hence during the crisis the economy always has ensured people cannot hold cash. All of these would impact consumer buying behaviors.
    
    What marketers need to realize is that digital money can increase global trade, enhance financial inclusion, and transform how we spend, save, and do business in ways we most likely do not even completely comprehend now. Therefore, there is an opportunity for improvised global branding. The introduction of the digital rupee has the potential to reduce the cost of payments, therefore positioning products will become more crucial than just branding.
    
    What human resources should consider now, though the digital rupee is not under blockchain technology yet the technologies used to keep the system running would require an extended technical knowledge base. It would also demand the extension of talent centers to find, select and recruit, train, and expand the technical talent base. It would also require major OD interventions with respect to doing business-to-consumer or business-to-business commerce in the market.
    
    Now the forum would remain open for discussions on the topic. Opinions on how digital rupees and its impact on market & marketing strategies, human resources highly appreciated. Jovial reading!"></Single>
