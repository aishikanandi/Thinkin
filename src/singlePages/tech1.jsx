      content="“Zero Trust” means “Believe No One”. Zero Trust is a term in association with security, a conception that the organizations today consider with paramount importance. Zero Trust uses robust authentication techniques, makes use of network segmentation, prevents lateral movement, offers Layer 7 threat protection, and streamlines granular, least access regulations in order to safeguard contemporary environments and facilitate digital transformation. The workforce today is constantly on the go and a large number of applications and data are accessed via multiple devices from many locations. So, with this kind of interaction with the common data from the diversified source, there is a question that would strike the minds of every end-user, “Am I accessing the safe data.” Therefor sure exists the fundamental level of security for such access that protects one’s enterprise network and data. This infrastructure is assumed to be defending against the ever-evolving threats like malware and targeted breaches that can emanate from anywhere by anyone. This kind of conventional perimeter security puts the business at stake and must transform to protect the business environment. The understanding that existing security solutions rely on the outdated concept that everything in a company's network should be trusted led to the creation of Zero Trust. Due to a lack of granular security controls, users on the network, including threat actors and malicious insiders, are allowed to move laterally and access or exfiltrate critical data as a result of this implicit trust. Therefore, the solution to this proposed was Zero Trust security architecture, which means verify and never trust which implies the access to apps and data is only given to authenticated and verified end-users where logs are monitored frequently and malware and predefined breaches are prevented.
      The technologies that hold Zero Trust upright is granular perimeter enforcement and micro-segmentation (for perfect network transparency) based on users and their whereabouts. Any case study on Zero Trust begins with the question “who the user exactly is?” and the policy hence maintained at the entry point of this architecture defines who and what kind of user is the person. To make this approach so very lively into action Zero Trust ropes in technologies such as IAM, end to end encryption, user and system level defined file permissions, MFA (Multi-factor authentication) and a very commonly seen application of MFA is 2FA (2-Way factor authentication). Gone are those days when organizations did believe the castle-fence model where they simply relied on the conventional security infrastructure set up that here refer to the fence around the castle, and believe everything that is inside the fence is safe and everything outside the fence is untrusted. They used firewalls and other technologies to create a security perimeter. But then a very baffling question arises “what if the perimeter was breached?”. Organizations because of their business requirements are moving to the cloud. As per security experts and further surveys it has been shown that clouds are the better place to start the Zero Trust. Another very fascinating question would be “how do I implement this?” Earlier it was a perception of being detailed implementation of security engineers working and deploying the above-mentioned technologies. But today with the introduction to the application like Cloudflare Access, any organization can implement zero-trust security with ease. This application controls access to one’s site and integrates with the enterprise Identity Provider for handling user credentials.
      
      A zero-trust strategy believes no network as safe even the internal fenced nework. For instance, workloads are prevented from interacting until a set of qualities, such as a fingerprint or identity, have verified their validity. Stronger security is provided by identity-based validation policies and follows the workload wherever it communicates, whether that be in a public cloud, a hybrid environment, a container, or an on-premises network architecture. Protection from both internal and external threats, data protection, increased network visibility, and compliance are advantages of implementing a zero-trust architecture.
      Believe no one in the long run approach has helped organizations these days to keep themselves away from the threats that could potentially disrupt the successful business flow and can shatter the entire reputation of the identity that one holds. In IT Zero Trust is no more perceived as technology or any kind of meager implementation but a mindset.
