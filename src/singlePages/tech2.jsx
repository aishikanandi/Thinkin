      content="What if I say you, that your refrigerator can help you by reminding you to buy a pack of cottage cheese when you are on the undersupply of same. The other day I came across a platform Alteryx, and therefore I thought of sharing my views on the trending technology hyperautomation. A one-liner, Alteryx, is a platform that holds the capability to process humongous documents using Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and provides quick insights from the data analysed from within the documents. 
      Hyperautomation is built on Robot Process Automation (RPA) with the amalgamation of advanced technologies like AI, ML, analytics, and Process mining. Hyperautomation utilizes the data collected over different kinds of digital platforms to draw inferences from them to make prompt and effective decision-making. Many organizations should look to adopt hyperautomation to perform their business operations seamlessly.
      The marketing function specifically, would be keen on retaining a positive and long customer relationship with the help of NLP where the machine learns and updates itself through interacting with consumers in real-time. Chatbots are one such example. Think from a shoe of seller's perspective in terms of lead generation where they fail to obtain data from people who visit their website, but not disclose any information. Hence sellers fall short in converting prospective leads. Therefore, by gathering IP-related digital footprints of the digital medium used, the system can store such information and can target useful and relevant information by launching a series of e-mails, or pre-approach sale calls.
      Human Resource Management should consider hyperautomation thoughtfully. RPA blended with AI generates a team of a virtual team to handle the monotonous functions to optimize employee performance. Other important aspects that we all were familiar with in HR functionality are candidate shortlisting, employee onboarding, employee exit, and employee management. Today we know how top organizations use hyperautomation to cut down their manual tasks which earlier charged them additional human resources, time, and money. 
      It was quite great to share a lot of applications of hyperautomation. It is quite debatable or rather open for a healthy discussion whether “Hyperautomation” can disrupt the marketplace by replacing human effort. If yes, how techies would vouch for this? How would Marketers see this as a game-changer strategy in the market? Would they still need a human touch, or would technology suffice and stand out for outstanding results? What would Human Resource Management opine about substituting human resources for important aspects? Would be happy to learn other perspectives from the readers as well. Jovial reading!
